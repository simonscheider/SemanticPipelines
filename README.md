# Semantic pipelines for synthesizing geo-analytical workflows
This repository contains Python processing scripts and ontologies that are used to automate geo-analytical workflow design and question-answering (QA). The main class is "pipeWorkflowInputs.py", which takes an OWL ontology (containing semantic data types) and a tool description (containing annotations of tool signatures), and produces files as input to the workflow synthesis tool APE.
