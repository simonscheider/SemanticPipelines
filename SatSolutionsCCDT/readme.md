# Workflow synthesis test for Core Concept Data Types (CCD)

In this folder, all sources for our preliminary workflow synthesis test using the CCD ontology [http://geographicknowledge.de/vocab/CoreConceptData](http://geographicknowledge.de/vocab/CoreConceptData.ttl) are included. The test is part of the article: [https://www.josis.org/index.php/josis/article/viewArticle/555](https://www.josis.org/index.php/josis/article/viewArticle/555). 

This includes:
* APE software (.jar)
* configuration files for different scenarios described in the paper
* constraint files for different scenarios described in the paper
* GISTaxonomy.rdf: a combined ontology of CCD ontology and tools.
* ToolDescription_ct.xml: the tool annotation file as input to APE.
* Solution workflows

Note that the software version of APE included here is 0.1.3. To get the newest version and source code, please refer to:  [https://github.com/sanctuuary/APE](https://github.com/sanctuuary/APE). Note also that a newer, corrected and extended version of the ontology and annotation files are available under: [https://github.com/simonscheider/SemanticPipelines](https://github.com/simonscheider/SemanticPipelines).
